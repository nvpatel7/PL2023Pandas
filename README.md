# Premier League 2023-2024 Scorer & Assister Analysis

This project aims to analyze the best scorers and assisters in the Premier League for the 2023-2024 season. It also evaluates the performance of forwards to identify which players have overperformed or underperformed based on their expected goals and assists.

## Project Overview

This notebook focuses on:
1. **Identifying top scorers and assisters**: The main objective was to discover the most impactful players in terms of goals and assists.
2. **Performance analysis of forwards**: Evaluating forwards who exceeded or fell short of their expected goals (xG) and assists (xA) to see who is overperforming or underperforming.

## Key Features

- **Data filtering**: The notebook filters player performance data to rank players based on goals, assists, and goal involvements.
- **Expected goals and assists**: Using the expected goals and assists (xG and xA) metrics, the project analyzes which forwards overperformed or underperformed compared to their expected statistics.
- **Yellow and Red cards**: The project also highlights players with disciplinary issues, such as those with a high number of yellow or red cards.
- **Team-based filtering**: Specific analysis on players from individual teams (e.g., Arsenal or Manchester United) who have performed well during the season.

## Usage

1. **Scorer and Assister Analysis**: The notebook contains code that ranks players based on their total goals and assists for the season.
2. **Overperformance/Underperformance**: Forward players are evaluated by comparing their actual goal contributions (goals + assists) with their expected values (xG + xA) to determine if they are overperforming or underperforming.
